## 💡 What the Script Does

Here's a breakdown of what each line in the script does:

```
@echo off             # Prevents the command prompt from displaying the commands in the script as they run
ipconfig.exe /all     # Displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values and refreshes DHCP and DNS settings
pause                 # Waits for the user to press a key before closing the command prompt window
```
